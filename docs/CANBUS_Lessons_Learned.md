# CANBUS Implementation - Lessons Learned

## Initial Approach (Over-engineered)
We initially created:
- CANBUSManager (singleton managing 3 buses)
- BrandHandlerInterface (abstract base)
- Brand-specific handlers (KeyaBrandHandler, etc.)
- CANBUSProcessor (PGN handling)
- CANSteerReadyDriver (adapter pattern)

## Why We Rolled Back

1. **Over-complicated**: Too many layers of abstraction for a simple problem
2. **No Auto-detection**: Most tractors don't send identifying messages
3. **Existing Pattern Works**: KeyaCANDriver shows the simple approach is fine
4. **User Configuration Needed**: Manual selection is required anyway

## New Approach (Simple and Unified)

Single TractorCANDriver that:
- Handles ALL CAN-based steering systems
- Configured entirely via web UI
- Based on proven KeyaCANDriver pattern
- Supports "None" option for buttons-only implementations

## Key Insights

1. **KISS Principle**: The simple solution is often the best
2. **User Experience**: Web configuration is better than code complexity
3. **Flexibility**: One configurable driver > many specific drivers
4. **Maintenance**: Less code = fewer bugs

## What We Keep

From the initial implementation, we learned:
- CAN bus pin assignments
- Message ID patterns
- Brand differences
- Multi-bus usage patterns

## Migration Path

For existing users:
- Keya users: Select "Keya Motor" + "CAN3 (V-Bus)" for steering
- New users: Simple dropdown selections
- Button-only users: Select brand + "None" for steering

## Code Reuse

We'll reuse:
- KeyaCANDriver as the template
- Global CAN bus instances
- Message processing patterns
- Safety timeout logic
